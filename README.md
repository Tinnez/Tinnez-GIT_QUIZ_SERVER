                                                     **QUIZ-GAME**

Inspired on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, The Quiz Game is open to anyone willing to put their knowledge to test in a series of questions and answers. Being a quiz competition, players have to correctly answer a serie of multiple choice questions in order to get money. Players accumulate money with each correct answer and it will determine the winner at the end of the game. Each player will start with 3 lifes, and will have three lifelines to assist them if they need help at any point in the game. The difficulty of the questions will be randomized to make it more interesting.
